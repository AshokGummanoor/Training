An operating system is a system software that acts as a link between the software and hardware components of a computer. It
receives requests from the other software on the system and communicates them to the hardware.

Open-source software refers to a program whose source code is publicly accessible so that the users can use, modify or distribute
it as they see fit. You also came to know that the different kinds of Linux distributions are ubuntu, fedora, debian etc.

A Linux distribution is an operating system based upon a singular Linux core and is available in a wide variety based upon who
wants to use the OS for what purpose. There are over 600 kinds of Linux distributions based on whether a certain distribution (also
called Distro) is made for embedded systems, personal computers, phones etc.
